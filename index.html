                    <p> At her mother's behest, 13-year-old Kiki sets out on a year-long
                        apprenticeship with her black cat in tow. With a shaky command of her broom, she ends up in a
                        charming little coastal town.
                        Unfortunately, the local hotels have a strict "no witches" policy and the police have taken a dim view
                        of her recent aerial mischief-making. She's saved from the street by a kindly baker's wife, who offers
                        her room and board in exchange for her delivering by broom the baker's wares. Soon she befriends a
                        college-aged artist, an old women who fusses over her, and a boy her same age who is nursing a massive
                        crush. All is well until she wakes up one day and realizes that she can't make her broom levitate nor
                        can she talk to her cat. </p>

                    <p>The story centers on an innocent romance
                        beginning to bud between Umi and Shun, two high school kids caught up in the changing times.
                        Japan is picking itself up from the devastation of World War II and preparing to host the 1964
                        Olympics - and the mood is one of both optimism and conflict as the young generation struggles
                        to throw off the shackles of a troubled past. While the children work together to save a dilapidated
                        Meiji era club house from demolition, their tentative relationship begins to blossom. But - in
                        an unexpected twist that parallels what the country itself is facing - a buried secret from their
                        past emerges to cast a shadow on the future and pull them apart.</p>

                    <p>Sent from her foster home in the city one summer to a sleepy town by the sea in Hokkaido, Anna
                        dreams her days away among the marshes. She believes she's outside the invisible magic circle
                        to which most people belong - and shuts herself off from everyone around her, wearing her "ordinary
                        face". Anna never expected to meet a friend like Marnie, who does not judge Anna for being just what
                        she is. But no sooner has Anna learned the loveliness of friendship than she begins to wonder about
                        her newfound friend... </p>

                    <p>Rarely seen outside of Japan, OCEAN WAVES is a subtle, poignant and wonderfully detailed story
                        of adolescence and teenage isolation. Taku and his best friend Yutaka are headed back to school
                        for what looks like another uneventful year. But they soon find their friendship tested by the
                        arrival of Rikako, a beautiful new transfer student from Tokyo whose attitude vacillates wildly
                        from flirty and flippant to melancholic. When Taku joins Rikako on a trip to Tokyo, the school
                        erupts with rumors, and the three friends are forced to come to terms with their changing relationships.</p>

                    <p>Suzuku Tsukishima is nearing the end of her final year of junior high. An avid bookworm, she devours
                        books while quietly dreaming about becoming a writer.
                        One day she meets Seiji, a lad who has the ability to both irritate and charm her, often at the
                        same time. He also harbors an unusual ambition: to build violins in Cremona, Italy. Around the same
                        time, she meets a kindly old man who owns an antique shop, whom she later learns is Seiji's grandfather.
                        One item in the store particularly catches her eye -- a strange statue of a cat with glittering eyes. </p>

                    <p>Jiro dreams of flying and designing beautiful airplanes, inspired by the famous Italian
                        aeronautical designer Caproni. Nearsighted from a young age and unable to be a pilot,
                        Jiro joins a major Japanese engineering company in 1927 and becomes one of the world's
                        most innovative and accomplished airplane designers. The film chronicles much of his life,

                        Depression, the tuberculosis epidemic and Japan's plunge into war. Jiro meets and falls
                        in love with Nahoko, and grows and cherishes his friendship with his colleague Honjo.</p>
